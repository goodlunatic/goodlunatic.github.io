# 2023 CISCN初赛 Misc 国粹 赛题详解

**这是一个搁置了很久的坑，想当初被折磨了好久，这题还是需要一点点脑洞的。**

<!--more-->

题目的附件很简单，一共就给了三张png图片：a.png、k.png、题目.png

![a.png](imgs/image-20240702172119774.png)

![k.png](imgs/image-20240702172140192.png)

![题目.png](imgs/image-20240702172155346.png)

发现a.png和k.png的图片尺寸大小是一样的，所以猜测可能是一一对应的关系

发现一一对应的关系后可能就比较容易想到是坐标

然后题目.png中应该就是每个麻将所对应的具体值，按照下图这样给每个麻将编号

然后把a和k中麻将的值作为横纵坐标的值，用以下脚本画图即可得到flag

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4,

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.xlabel('a')
plt.ylabel('k')
plt.show()
